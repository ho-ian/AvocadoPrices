# AvocadoPrices

The goal of this Jupyter Notebook was to illustrate some data science techniques I have learned. The initial goal was to explore the data a little bit before trying to predict regions based off of monthly average price of avocados, year, month, and type. However, after cleaning the data and using a simple RandomForestClassifier, I found that to be extremely inaccurate. So, I decided to analyse the data some more, looking at density graphs to see which prices appeared the most across years and across regions.
